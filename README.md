L2 Normalisation

Canny Edges
1 Filter image with derivative of Gaussian

2 Find magnitude and orientation of gradient

3 Non-maximum suppression

4 Linking and thresholding (hysteresis):
Define two thresholds: low and high
Use the high threshold to start edge curves and the low threshold to continue them
